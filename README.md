# React Application to complete the internship in a front-end development course

This react app is the final project for a internship in the course "Code4SP" where I learned JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and a short introduction to databases. Since back-end development wans't in the scope of the internship this repository only contains the front-end code.

React is a javascript library that facilitates the development of single-page applications (SPA) through the use of components.

The app has the following components: a Header, a Footer, three different pages + a sticky button that make use of the SPA method, a picture slider, aka carousel, that is used in of the pages and lastly a contact form page that is only available after clicking in the sticky button.

The next steps for this project would be to create a back-end for the website + a database of clients.
